#Feature Extraction
#i. Pixel Features
The number of pixels in an image is the same as the size of the image for grayscale images we can find the pixel features by reshaping the shape of the image and returning the array form of the image.
pixel_features1 = np.reshape(image2, (1600*1600))
features.shape, pixel_features1
Output:
 
#pixel feature for the colored image
pixel_features2 = np.reshape(image1, (1600*1600*3))
features.shape, pixel_features2
output:
